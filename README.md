### GamePlay
User is playing against computer. User always plays for X, and computer always as 0. The first player to line up his three pieces vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins, and the game ends there. In the case when all cells are filled and the winner is not determined, the game ends with a draw. In any time user can click restart button, to start a game from the beginning.
